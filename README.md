Universal Transparent Widgets for Scriptable

# Widget Setup
After downloading both JavaScript files in the repo, move them to your Scriptable folder and first run no-background. Once it has finished running, the backgrounds should be saved and you can now select the script in a home screen widget. The input parameter determines what the current widget will be saved as (includes size and position).
